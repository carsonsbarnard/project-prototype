	This prototype is to show general functionality of what our bookstore will offer.   
		On our main page, we have our banner, login/profile options, a link back to the main page if they get lost, and our body which contains   
			the relevant info/thumbnail for books we have on display, section by section.   
		On our About page is a brief description of our 'mission' and our projects basic premise.   
		On our Contact page is a query where you can submit your name, email, and a message for the creators of the site.   
		Our Admin options allow us to create users, listings, and profiles, as well as delete and alter them. They allow us to delete reviews   
			that are obscene or inappropriate, and monitor the sites health as a whole.   
		Our provider pages allow publishers to list their books on our page to then be sold
All of this is in an aim to demonstrate how our site will function once completed!
