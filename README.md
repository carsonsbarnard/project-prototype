This prototype is to show general functionality of what our bookstore will offer./n
On our main page, we have our banner, login/profile options, a link back to the main page if they get lost, and our body which contains/n
the relevant info/thumbnail for books we have on display, section by section./n
On our About page is a brief description of our 'mission' and our projects basic premise./n
On our Contact page is a query where you can submit your name, email, and a message for the creators of the site./n
Our Admin options allow us to create users, listings, and profiles, as well as delete and alter them. They allow us to delete reviews/n
that are obscene or inappropriate, and monitor the sites health as a whole./n
Our provider pages allow publishers to list their books on our page to then be sold/n

All of this is in an aim to demonstrate how our site will function once completed!
